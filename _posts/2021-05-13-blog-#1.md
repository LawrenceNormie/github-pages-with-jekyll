<center> <h1>##Community Volunteer Work##</h1></center>

Not _everyone_ is cut out for community volunteer work. I refer specifically to the sort that delivers respite and help to the poverty stricken, sick, or otherwise socially disadvantaged and vulnerable. 
Other than strong motivation and steadfast dedication, volunteer workers require the basic practical wherewithal to make an appreciable difference for their chosen causes. Obvious criteria include sufficient available time as well as access to and mobility within the communities of interest. Less tangible but no less important necessary attributes include patience, compassion, a cheerful countenance, and the willingness to make personal sacrifices, especially of oneâ€™s own leisure time.
Time commitment on a consistent basis usually is the hardest requisite for most volunteers, including seasoned veterans; and it is the one most likely to cause prospective recruits to baulk at the responsibility of regular volunteer work. In another respect, the time commitment challenge, should be considered as a positive thing; there is hardly anything more disruptive to the smooth running of volunteer operations than the unpredictable availability and unreliability of lackadaisical members.
